		<h2>Mission<hr style="width: 100%"></h2>
		<p>Our mission is to provide job with the best environment to the village girls so that they can earn with their skills and become self independent.<br>

Our mission is to provide the job in the village areas because we see the most girls in the villages who are educated or skilled but have no job so that they can earn or show their skills.</p>

	<div class="vission">
		<h2>Vision<hr style="width: 100%"></h2>
		<p>While we are starting from a small level but as we will improve our market places with our product quality, our vision is to provide the huge number of jobs to the village girls who are eager to stand by their own and want to become self independent.<br>

To give the an environment in which the our team can improve their skills and they can choose the work field as per their skills and interests.</p>

		<div class="goals">
		<h2>Goals<hr style="width: 100%"></h2>
		<p>Our goal is to help the girls from village areas to improve their talent and skills in the field they are interested. We see the girls are very talented either in making any handcraft, hand-made product, singing, dancing, drawing, art, decorating their home, cooking, or painting.<br>
			They have the problem solving mind but without any platform or chances their talent and skills are worthless. And this is major factor their family marry them soon without their future or career.
